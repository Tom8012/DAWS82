# 1. AWS Compute Services ‚Äî Detailed Overview (3 Years Experience Level)

---

## a) **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**

### What it is:

* Virtual servers (‚Äúinstances‚Äù) that you can launch in the cloud.
* You choose the OS (Linux, Windows), instance type (CPU, memory), storage, networking, etc.
* It‚Äôs Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS).

### Key concepts:

* **Instance types:** Optimized for CPU, memory, storage, GPU, or general purpose (e.g., t3.micro, m5.large).
* **AMI (Amazon Machine Image):** Pre-configured OS + software images to launch instances quickly.
* **EBS (Elastic Block Store):** Persistent storage volumes attached to EC2 instances.
* **Security groups:** Firewall rules controlling inbound/outbound traffic.
* **Elastic IP:** Static IP you can assign to an instance.

### Use cases:

* Running web servers, application servers, databases (self-managed), batch processing, custom workloads.
* When you need full control over the OS and environment.
* Scaling horizontally with Auto Scaling Groups (ASG).

### Best practices:

* Use **Auto Scaling** to handle varying load automatically.
* Use **Elastic Load Balancers (ELB)** to distribute traffic across instances.
* Monitor instances with **CloudWatch** (CPU, disk, network).
* Use **spot instances** for cost savings with flexible workloads.
* Harden security by minimizing open ports, regularly patching OS.

### Common challenges:

* Managing patching and updates.
* Cost management if instances run 24/7 without optimization.
* Handling instance failures (use ASG for automatic replacement).

---

## b) **AWS Lambda**

### What it is:

* Serverless compute ‚Äî run code without provisioning or managing servers.
* Event-driven ‚Äî code runs in response to triggers (API calls, file uploads, database updates).

### Key concepts:

* **Functions:** Small units of code (in Node.js, Python, Java, etc.) that execute quickly.
* **Event sources:** API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB Streams, CloudWatch Events, etc.
* **Cold start:** Initial delay when a Lambda function runs after some idle time.
* **Limits:** Timeout (up to 15 mins), memory (up to 10 GB).

### Use cases:

* Backend for serverless web/mobile apps.
* Data processing pipelines (e.g., image processing when uploaded to S3).
* Scheduled tasks or cron jobs.
* Lightweight APIs or glue code connecting services.

### Best practices:

* Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility).
* Manage dependencies carefully to reduce cold start latency.
* Use **CloudWatch Logs** for debugging and monitoring.
* Design with retries and error handling in mind (e.g., DLQs).
* Integrate with API Gateway for HTTP interfaces.

### Common challenges:

* Cold start latency impacting performance-sensitive apps.
* Limits on execution time or package size.
* Debugging distributed serverless apps can be tricky.

---

## c) **Elastic Beanstalk**

### What it is:

* Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for deploying and managing web applications.
* Automatically handles capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and health monitoring.

### Key concepts:

* Supports multiple platforms: Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby, .NET, Docker, etc.
* Abstracts away infrastructure management, so you focus on app code.
* Environment configuration is customizable.

### Use cases:

* Rapid deployment of web apps without deep infrastructure knowledge.
* Teams wanting managed scaling but with some control over environment.

### Best practices:

* Use configuration files for environment setup (e.g., software, scaling).
* Monitor environment health and logs via console or CLI.
* Use **Blue/Green deployments** to minimize downtime during updates.

### Common challenges:

* Less flexibility than managing EC2 directly.
* Sometimes configuration changes require environment rebuilds.

---

## d) **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)**

### What it is:

* Managed container orchestration service supporting Docker containers.
* You run containers on a cluster of EC2 instances or using **Fargate** (serverless compute for containers).

### Key concepts:

* **Task Definitions:** Blueprints for containers (images, CPU/memory, ports).
* **Clusters:** Logical groups of container instances.
* **Services:** Ensure a specified number of task instances are running.
* Supports integration with ALB (Application Load Balancer) and IAM roles.

### Use cases:

* Running microservices architectures with containers.
* Batch jobs in containers.
* Deploying apps with complex dependency trees.

### Best practices:

* Use **Fargate** to avoid managing servers if possible.
* Set resource limits on tasks to avoid noisy neighbors.
* Use CloudWatch Container Insights for monitoring.
* Use IAM roles for task security.

### Common challenges:

* Managing stateful containers.
* Networking complexity with VPC, security groups.
* Debugging container failures.

---

## e) **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**

### What it is:

* Fully managed Kubernetes service.
* Runs Kubernetes control plane and lets you manage your worker nodes.

### Key concepts:

* Kubernetes concepts (pods, deployments, services) apply.
* Integrates with AWS IAM, VPC, CloudWatch.
* Supports **Fargate** for serverless Kubernetes pods.

### Use cases:

* Organizations standardized on Kubernetes.
* Running complex containerized apps with multi-cluster needs.
* Hybrid cloud or multi-cloud deployments.

### Best practices:

* Use Kubernetes best practices for manifests, namespaces, and RBAC.
* Monitor with Prometheus + CloudWatch.
* Use managed node groups or Fargate for worker nodes.

### Common challenges:

* Kubernetes has steep learning curve.
* Cluster upgrades and management.
* Cost optimization (nodes running 24/7).
